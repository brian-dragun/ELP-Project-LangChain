    "Which lease needs renegotiation first?",
    "To determine which lease needs renegotiation first, we need to consider the lease end years and other relevant factors such as vacancy rates and rent per square foot.\n\n1. **Lease End Year**: The first step is to identify which leases are ending soonest. According to the provided information:\n   - Philadelphia lease ends in 2030.\n   - Los Angeles lease ends in 2031.\n   - Chicago lease ends in 2031.\n   - New York City lease ends in 2032.\n\n   The Philadelphia lease ends the earliest in 2030.\n\n2. **Current Year**: The current year is 2025. \n   - Time left for Philadelphia lease: 5 years.\n   - Time left for Los Angeles and Chicago leases: 6 years.\n   - Time left for New York City lease: 7 years.\n\n3. **Vacancy Rate and Rent**: \n   - Philadelphia has a vacancy rate of 12.4% and a rent per SF of $38.25.\n   - Alpha Tower in Philadelphia, a specific office, has a vacancy rate of 25%.\n   - Los Angeles has a vacancy rate of 10.5% and a rent per SF of $48.72.\n   - Chicago has a vacancy rate of 11.0% and a rent per SF of $38.69.\n   - New York City has a vacancy rate of 9.8% and a rent per SF of $75.\n\n4. **Analysis**: \n   - The Philadelphia lease is the first to end in 2030, which is relatively soon.\n   - It has a significant total square feet of 87,500, indicating a large lease.\n   - The vacancy rate in Philadelphia is 12.4%, which is higher than Los Angeles (10.5%), Chicago (11.0%), and New York City (9.8%), suggesting that renegotiation might be more challenging due to the higher vacancy rate.\n   - Alpha Tower, a specific office in Philadelphia, has an even higher vacancy rate of 25%, which could impact the renegotiation if this is the specific property related to the lease.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Confidence Levels**:\n   - We assume that the need for renegotiation is primarily driven by the lease end year and market conditions (vacancy rate, rent per SF).\n   - We are confident (100%) in the lease end years for all cities.\n   - We are confident (100%) in the vacancy rates and rent per SF for the cities.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   Given that the Philadelphia lease ends the soonest (in 2030) and considering the current year is 2025, it is reasonable to conclude that the Philadelphia lease needs renegotiation first. The higher vacancy rate in Philadelphia and the significant size of the lease further support this conclusion, as there is a greater need to address the lease terms before its end.\n\n**Answer**: Philadelphia lease needs renegotiation first. (Confidence Level: 100% based on lease end year, with additional contextual support from vacancy rates and lease size)"

    "Which office had the highest average occupancy in April 2025?",
    "To determine which office had the highest average occupancy in April 2025, we need to analyze the available data on occupancy rates for different offices.\n\n1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - We have specific occupancy rates for offices in Philadelphia (Alpha Tower) and New York (Beta Center).\n   - The occupancy rate for Alpha Tower in Philadelphia is given as 75% (Confidence: 100%).\n   - The occupancy rate for Beta Center in New York is given as 60% (Confidence: 100%).\n   - There's also a mention of the Delta Point office in Miami having a 50% occupancy rate (From memory, Source: Second document).\n\n2. **Assumptions**:\n   - The available data assumes current occupancy rates are indicative of the average occupancy in April 2025 (Confidence: 80%). This implies that the occupancy rates provided are assumed to be relatively stable or representative of the average occupancy during April 2025.\n\n3. **Verification Against Document Context**:\n   - The document context provides occupancy rates for Alpha Tower (Philadelphia) and Beta Center (New York) from \"test_office_vacancy.csv.\"\n   - The occupancy rate for Alpha Tower is 75%, and for Beta Center, it is 60%.\n   - There's a mention of the Delta Point office in Miami having a 50% occupancy rate from a different source.\n\n4. **Comparing Occupancy Rates**:\n   - Alpha Tower (Philadelphia): 75%\n   - Beta Center (New York): 60%\n   - Delta Point (Miami): 50%\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided data, Alpha Tower in Philadelphia has the highest occupancy rate at 75%.\n   - Since we are assuming the current occupancy rates are indicative of the average occupancy in April 2025, Alpha Tower would have the highest average occupancy in April 2025.\n\n6. **Confidence Level**:\n   - The confidence level for the occupancy rates of Alpha Tower and Beta Center is 100% because they are directly stated in the document context.\n   - The confidence level for the assumption that current occupancy rates are indicative of April 2025 average occupancy is 80%.\n\n**Answer**: The office with the highest average occupancy in April 2025 is Alpha Tower in Philadelphia."

    "Which office had the highest average occupancy in April 2025?",
    "To determine which office had the highest average occupancy in April 2025, we need to analyze the available data and consider the assumptions we're making.\n\n1. **Available Data**: The data provided includes the occupancy rates of two offices: Alpha Tower in Philadelphia with an occupancy rate of 75% and Beta Center in New York with an occupancy rate of 60%. This information is derived from the document context, specifically from \"test_office_vacancy.csv\".\n\n2. **Assumptions**: We are assuming that the current occupancy rates are indicative of the average occupancy rates in April 2025. This is because there is no specific data provided for office occupancy rates in April 2025.\n\n3. **Verification Against Document Context**: The document context confirms that the Alpha Tower has an occupancy rate of 75% and the Beta Center has an occupancy rate of 60%. There's no direct information on the occupancy rates for April 2025, so our assumption is based on the available current data.\n\n4. **Confidence Levels**:\n   - The occupancy rate of Alpha Tower (75%) and Beta Center (60%) is known with 100% confidence based on the provided data.\n   - The assumption that current occupancy rates are indicative of the average occupancy in April 2025 has a lower confidence level because it's based on an inference rather than direct data for April 2025. Let's assign this an 80% confidence level due to the lack of specific April 2025 data.\n\nGiven the available data and assumptions, the Alpha Tower in Philadelphia had the highest average occupancy in April 2025 at 75%. Our confidence in this answer is tempered by the assumption that current occupancy rates reflect April 2025 averages, which we have assigned an 80% confidence level.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **Alpha Tower in Philadelphia had the highest average occupancy in April 2025 at 75%.** (Confidence Level: 80% due to the assumption about average occupancy in April 2025)"
