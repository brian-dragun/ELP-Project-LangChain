    "Overall Confidence: 77%",
    "**Final Answer**: There's not enough information to directly answer what \"Overall Confidence: 77%\" refers to. However, if we were to consider a scenario where this confidence level relates to predicting or analyzing one of the provided metrics (like meeting room utilization), we could potentially use the data to support such an analysis. For instance, the average meeting room utilization rate in Philadelphia is around 55% (based on `phl_meeting_room_utilization.csv` summary), and if a predictive model had a confidence level of 77% in its predictions, this could imply a certain level of reliability in forecasting future utilization rates. Without a specific question, the most accurate response is that there's insufficient information to provide a definitive answer."
