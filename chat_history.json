    "How many people in the NYC Office?",
    "To determine the number of people in the NYC Office, we need to analyze the given information and context.\n\n1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n   - The NYC office has 123 employees. (Confidence: 100%)\n   - There are records of entries and exits on specific dates (April 17, 2025, April 23, 2025, and April 5, 2025) indicating the presence of people in the office.\n   - The occupancy rate of the Beta Center in New York, where presumably the NYC office is located, is 60%. (Confidence: 100%)\n\n2. **Understanding the Question**:\n   - The question asks for the number of people in the NYC Office. It does not specify a particular time or date.\n\n3. **Assumptions and Considerations**:\n   - To estimate the number of people present, we can either directly use the number of employees if the question implies the total number of employees or use the entry/exit records for a specific date if it's asking for the number of people present at a particular time.\n   - The occupancy rate could be related to the building (Beta Center) rather than the specific office (NYC office), so it might not directly inform us about the number of people in the NYC office.\n\n4. **Verifying Claims Against the Document Context**:\n   - The number of employees in the NYC office is given as 123. This directly answers the question if we're considering the total number of employees.\n   - The entry/exit records show at least 17 entries/exits on April 17, 2025, at least 16 on April 23, 2025, and at least 16 on April 5, 2025. However, these numbers do not necessarily represent the total number of people present, as some individuals might have been counted multiple times (entry and exit).\n\n5. **Confidence Levels**:\n   - We are 100% confident that the NYC office has 123 employees.\n   - The number of people present on specific dates can be estimated from entry/exit records, but the confidence in these numbers representing the total people present at any given time is lower due to the potential for multiple counts (entries and exits).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the question is asking for the total number of employees in the NYC office, the answer is 123. (Confidence: 100%)\n   - If the question is asking for the number of people present at a particular time, we would need more specific information about that time or date to provide an accurate count based on the entry/exit records.\n\nGiven the information and the phrasing of the question, the most straightforward interpretation is that it's asking for the total number of employees in the NYC office.\n\n**Answer**: 123 (Total number of employees in the NYC office, Confidence: 100%)"
