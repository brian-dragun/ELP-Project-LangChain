## Advanced Features

### Document Processing

The system handles various document types including:
- CSV files
- PDFs
- Text files
- HTML documents
- Markdown files
- Excel spreadsheets
- Word documents

### Incremental Updates

The system uses a hash-based approach to detect document changes and update the vector database incrementally, avoiding full reprocesses when only some files have changed.

### Cross-Document Analysis

Special processing is applied to documents like employee data to create cross-document insights that make it easy to compare data across offices.

## üß† Prompt Design Philosophy

Prompts are structured instructions that control what the AI does. In our system, they ensure:

- Answers are **grounded in ingested documents**
- Facts are **extracted with sources + confidence**
- Claims are **verified** before being presented
- Responses show **step-by-step reasoning**
- AI finds **insights and summaries** automatically

## Customization

The system can be customized by modifying:

- `config.py` - System configuration options
- `ai_agent.py` - Core LLM integration 
- `reasoning.py` - Reasoning service
- Document loaders in `ingest_documents.py` for new document types

## Future Improvements

See `z_improvements.md` for a list of planned enhancements.
